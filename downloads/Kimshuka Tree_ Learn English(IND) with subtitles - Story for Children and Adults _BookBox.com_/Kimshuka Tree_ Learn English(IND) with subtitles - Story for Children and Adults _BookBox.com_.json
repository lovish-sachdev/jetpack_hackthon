    "description": "This story is an offering for the 150th Birth Anniversary of Sri Aurobindo\n\nKimshuka Tree\nA story about Truth, \nadapted from Tales of All Times \nby The Mother\n\nThere were four young\nprinces of Banaras \nwho were brothers.\nEach one of them said\nto their father's charioteer:\n“I want to see a Kimshuka tree.”\n“I will show you,”\nsaid the charioteer,\nand he invited the eldest\nto go for a ride.\nIn the jungle\nhe showed the prince\na Kimshuka tree.\nIt was the time of year\nwhen there are neither buds,\nnor leaves, nor flowers.\nSo the prince saw only\na trunk of dark wood.\nA few weeks later,\nthe second prince\nwas taken for a ride\nin the chariot\nand he also saw\nthe Kimshuka tree.\nHe found it covered with leaves.\nA little later in the season,\nthe third brother\nsaw it in his turn;\nit was reddish orange\nwith flowers.\nAt last the fourth saw it;\nits fruits were ripe.\nOne day\nwhen the four brothers\nwere together,\nsomeone asked:\n“What does\nthe Kimshuka tree look like?”\nThe eldest said:\n“Like a bare trunk.”\nThe second:\n“Like a flourishing banana tree.”\nThe third:\n“Like a pink and red bouquet.”\nAnd the fourth:\n“Like an acacia laden with fruit.”\nBeing unable to agree,\nthey went together\nto their father the king\nfor him to decide who was right.\nWhen he heard how\none after the other\nthe young princes\nhad seen the Kimshuka tree,\nthe king smiled and said:\n“All four of you are right,\nbut all four of you forget\nthat the tree is\nnot the same in all seasons.”\nEach one was describing\nwhat he had seen\nand each one\nwas ignorant\nof what the others knew.\nIn this way, most often,\npeople know\nonly a fraction of the truth,\nand their error comes precisely\nfrom the fact\nthat they think they know it all.\nHow much less\nthis error would be\nif they had learnt\nat an early age\nto love truth so much\nthat they would always seek it\nmore and more.\n\nNarration: Maurice Shukla\nMusic: Jerry Silvester Vincent\nSFX: Rajesh Gilbert\nIllustrations: Kallol Majumder\nAnimation: BookBox\nStory: Tales of All Times © Sri Aurobindo Ashram Trust, Pondicherry.\n\nWEBSITE: http://www.bookbox.com\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/BookBoxInc/\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/bookboxinc/\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/bookboxInc\n\n#BookBox #BookBoxEnglish #Learn2Read",
