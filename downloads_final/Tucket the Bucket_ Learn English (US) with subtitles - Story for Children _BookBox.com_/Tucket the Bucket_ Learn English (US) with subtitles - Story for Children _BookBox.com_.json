You already have a big hole \nat the bottom!” said the girl \nas she peered inside. \n“Even better!” \nTucket could not believe \nwhat he had just heard. \nShe wanted a bucket with a hole? \nThe girl \ntook him to the veranda, \nfilled him with rich soil \nand planted a tiny rose inside.  \n“This is a baby rose,” \nshe said to Tucket. \n“You must help me \ntake care of her, OK?” \nTucket was so happy. \nThe girl really wanted him! \nShe even asked him \nto take care of this small rose. \nTucket nearly burst with joy. \nHe straightened himself up \nproudly \nas the girl finished planting. \nShe carefully placed Tucket \nin the best spot of the veranda. \nIt was a cozy corner, \nprotected from the wind \nand the rain. \nTucket winked \nand smiled at his friends \nin the garden. \n“Look, \nI’m taking care of this little rose!” \n“We’re very happy \nfor you, Tucket!” \nchattered the squirrels, \nand the birds chirped happily. \nTucket \ntook great care of the rose \nand was visited by the girl \nand his friends every day. \nHe was now \nthe happiest bucket \nin the world.\n\nIllustrations: Charudatta Prabhu Desai\nMusic & Art Direction: Holger Jetter\nAnimation: BookBox\n\nWEBSITE: http://www.bookbox.com\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/BookBoxInc/\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/bookboxinc/\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/bookboxInc\n#BookBox #BookBoxEnglish #Learn2Read",
