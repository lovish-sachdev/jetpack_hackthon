Awoo!” cry of his fellow jackals \nfrom a distance. \nHe just could not control himself. \nInstinctively, \nhe too craned his neck high in the air \nand let out a loud “Awoo! Awoo”. \nWhen the animals heard this, \nthey were absolutely stunned. \nThey soon figured out \nwhat was going on. \nMeanwhile, \nChandrao realized his foolishness \nand ran for his life. \nBut how could he escape \nfrom so many angry animals?  \nWell, I don’t need to describe \nthe punishment he got!\n\nStory: Rewritten by BookBox\nIllustration: Kallol Majumder\nNarration: Tara Kathori  &  Bernadette Joseph\nMusic: Rajesh Gilbert\nAnimation: BookBox\n\nWEBSITE: http://www.bookbox.com\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/BookBoxInc/\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/bookboxinc/\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/bookboxInc\n\n#BookBox #BookBoxEnglish #Learn2Read",
