I dream of them.\nBright yellow,\nher headlights blinked.\nShe looked like a red fairy.\nQuestions whirled in my mind.\nI cycled to the colony gate.\nI asked Guard Chacha\nif he knew anything about this\nsparkling little red car.\nHe laughed and said,\n“You like that car?\nThat car and its owner\nhave recently moved here.\nThey live in house number 112.”\n“Thank you,” I said\nand cycled home again.\nThat evening,\nI went to house number 112.\nThen I saw Red Fairy\nbehind a gate.\nThere was a cable attached\nto her left.\nOoooo,\nRed Fairy moved with electricity,\nnot petrol or diesel.\nThe next day, I saw Red Fairy\nwhizzing past.\nI ran behind her\nand raised my hand to stop her.\nShe stopped!\nSitting inside\nwas a white-haired lady\nwho smiled at me.\nShe looked like my Nani.\nI gently patted Red Fairy\nand told Nani,\n“I am a car expert\nbut I have never seen a car\nlike this.\nI really like her.\nCan I call her Red Fairy?\n“You have given this little one\na wonderful name!”\nsaid Nani.\nNani offered to take me\nfor a drive.\nI was so excited.\nI ran home\nand asked Ma for permission\nto go with Nani.\nThen I jumped into\nRed Fairy’s lap for a ride.\nAs we whizzed down the roads,\nI could hear no roar,\nonly a purr.\nI asked Nani\nwhy the car was so quiet.\nShe said,\n“Red Fairy makes no noise\nand emits no smoke.”\nRed Fairy zipped between cars.\nAt a red light,\nan auto rickshaw driver\nwas curious about Red Fairy\nand asked questions about her.\nThe light turned green\nand we drove on.\nSoon we were at India Gate.\nNani bought ice creams for us.\nEverything was grey.\nNani said it was the smog\nthat made things grey.\nI told her\nthat my papa said that\nthe air in Delhi was very polluted.\n“The smoke that comes out\nof cars\nadds to this pollution,\nwhich is why\nmy mother doesn’t like my interest\nin cars.”\nSuddenly I felt\nthat Red Fairy was\nwhispering to me.\n“Meeto, I do not pollute the air\nlike other cars do.\nAlso, I take very little space\nto move and park.”\nI was now convinced\nthat Red Fairy was magical.\nNo smoke,\nno sound,\nno petrol and no diesel.\nAnd she was talking to me.\n“Cars that use alternative energy\ncan reduce air pollution.\nWho knows,\nyou could become a scientist\nand invent cars\nthat cause no pollution at all,”\nsaid Nani.\nI decided\nthat I would invent a new car\nand call it Vibgyor Fairy.\n\nAuthor : Kamla Bhasin\nIllustrations : Tanvi Bhat\nNarration : Tara Kothari & Bernadette Joseph\nMusic : Rajesh Gilbert\nAnimation : BookBox\n\nThis story has been provided for free under the CC-BY license by Pratham Books, which is a not-for-profit children's books publisher with a mission to see \"A book in every child's hand\".
