Ponn! Pa!\nThe cows did not like the noise at all.\nThey forced Sringeri Srinivas\nto take them back home.\nBut the noise\nstayed inside Sringeri Srinivas's head\nand came back home with him.\nEven the sounds\nthat Sringeri Srinivas heard daily\nsuddenly became too loud for him.\nThe frogs, the koyals, the cows, the tiger.\nWhy were they so noisy?\nPoor Sringeri Srinivas.\nHe only wanted silence.\nHe shouted at the children\nif they talked loudly.\nEveryone tried to help.\nThe children played cricket quietly.\nThe cows did not moo any more.\nYet Sringeri Srinivas was not happy.\n\"I will go away from this noisy place,\"\nhe declared one morning.\nHe walked away from his village\nand reached a new town,\nwhich was even noisier.\nHe met a young man\nwearing headphones,\nwho seemed very happy,\nin spite of all the honking.\n\"Aha, this is just what I need,\" he said.\nHe bought a big pair of headphones.\nNo more noise!\nNow, when Sringeri Srinivas\ngets very angry at the cars or the frogs,\nhe just puts on his headphones\nand listens to some quiet music.\nBut he still has to take his cows\nto the cattle fair along the noisy highway.\nMaybe his cows need headphones too!\n\nStory: Noni\nIllustrations: Angie & Upesh\nMusic Composed and Arranged by: Jerry Silvester Vincent\nSFX Design, Mix and Mastered by: Jerry Silvester Vincent\nAnimation: BookBox\n\nThis story has been provided for free under the CC-BY license by Pratham Books, which is a not-for-profit children's books publisher with a mission to see \"A book in every child's hand\".
