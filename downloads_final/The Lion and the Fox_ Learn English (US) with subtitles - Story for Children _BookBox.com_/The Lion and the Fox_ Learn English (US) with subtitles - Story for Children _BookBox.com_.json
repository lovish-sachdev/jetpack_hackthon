Where? Show me!”\nsaid the greedy man.\nSo the fox led the man\nhere and there\nand round and round the forest…\nand took him\nto where the hungry lion\nwas waiting.\nThe lion leapt towards the man.\nThe man shot up the closest tree \njust like a monkey.\nThe lion and the fox\nwere not too worried.\nThey knew the man could not escape.\nThey started discussing\nhow they would share the food.\n“I’ll start with the toes,”\nsaid the lion.\n“I’ll start with the fingers,”\nsaid the fox.\nOne by one\nthey chose who would eat what.\nFinally,\nthe lion licked his lips and said,\n“I will eat the brain. Mmmm!”\nNow the fox had also been dreaming\nabout eating the man’s brain.\nShe told the lion,\n“But this animal has no brain!\nIf he did,\nwould he cut all the trees\nand destroy the forest?”\nUp on the tree,\nthe man nodded sadly.\nThe fox was right.\nHe had been looking around\nfor trees to jump onto\nand run away.\nBut there were none nearby!\n\nStory: Deepa Balsavar\nIllustrations: Amrita Kanther\nMusic: Jerry Silvester Vincent\nAnimation: BookBox\n\n\"The Lion and the Fox\" is the eighth animated story of a brand new series called \"Little BookBoxers\".
