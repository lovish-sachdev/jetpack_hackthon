I woke up. \nHow did I wake up?” \nhe asked in wonder. \n“I woke you up,” said the fly. \n“Could you wake me up \nearly like this every morning?” \n“Sure,” said the fly. \nBheema was finally happy. \nThis trick would work!\n\nStory: Srividhya Venkat\nIllustrations: Anupama Ajinkya Apte\nTranslation: Pratham Books Team\nNarration: Akash Kothari, Bernadette Joseph & Tara Kothari\nMusic: Rajesh Gilbert\nAnimation: BookBox\n\nThis story has been provided for free under the CC-BY license by Pratham Books, which is a not-for-profit children's books publisher with a mission to see \"A book in every child's hand\".
