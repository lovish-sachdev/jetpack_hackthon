Farms.”\nSringeri Srinivas \noffered one to the priest.\n“Each one has the pulp of 4 bananas.\nThere are 27 packets.\nSo here are your 108 ripe bananas!”\nThe priest was so surprised \nthat he forgot to chant.\nIn the silence, \none child began to laugh.\nSoon the whole village \nwas laughing and clapping.\nNow we know \nwhat Sringeri Srinivas does \nwith all the bananas that he grows!\n\nStory: Noni\nIllustrations: Angie & Upesh\nMusic: Jerry Silvester Vincent\nNarration: Jeremy Roske\nAnimation: BookBox\n\nThis story has been provided for free under the CC-BY license by Pratham Books, which is a not-for-profit children's books publisher with a mission to see \"A book in every child's hand\".
