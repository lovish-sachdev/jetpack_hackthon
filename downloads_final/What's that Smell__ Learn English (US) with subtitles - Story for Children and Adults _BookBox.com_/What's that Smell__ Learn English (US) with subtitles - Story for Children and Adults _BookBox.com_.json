What’s that smell?” \ncries Tara. \n“A MONSTER!” yells Madhav. \nIt is hot, dark and stinky. \nThe whole house smells! \nWhere is the smell coming from?\nMa checks the bedroom. \nMadhav checks the bathroom. \nTara checks the dining room. \nPa checks the kitchen.\n“It’s coming from there,” says Pa, \npointing at the fridge. \n“A stinky fridge monster?” gasps Tara.\n“Scared,” says Madhav, hugging Ma. \n“Let’s open the fridge \nand see what’s inside,” says Ma. \nMa opens the fridge. \nEveryone covers their noses \nand mouths.\n“Hmm, it’s warm inside \nand the light is off,” says Ma, \nsticking her arm into the fridge. \n“What happened?” asks Tara. \n\"The fridge stopped working \nsome time ago,” Pa explains.\n\"Without the cold air, \neverything spoiled,” says Ma, glumly. \n“Has the milk gone bad?” asks Tara. \n“Yes, can you smell how sour it is?” \nasks Ma. \n“Milk needs to be kept cold \nto stay fresh,” says Pa.\n“Has the bread gone bad?” \nasks Tara. \n“Yes, do you see that green stuff? \nThat’s mold,” says Pa, \n“It grows on the bread.” \n“Fuzzy,” says Madhav, curiously. \n“Don’t touch it,” says Pa. \n“You’ll fall sick if you eat it.” \n“Have the vegetables gone bad too?” \nasks Tara, sadly. \n“Yes, they’re rotten,” says Ma. \n“We can’t eat them.” \nMadhav picks up an egg \nand drops it. \n“Madhav, now it smells even worse!” \nshouts Tara. \n“Oh no! These have gone bad too,” \nsays Pa.\nTara is sure \nshe can never eat eggs again. \n“Yuck, yuck, yuck!”\ncries Madhav, running away \nwhile Pa cleans up the mess. \nThey put all the rotten food \ninto garbage bags \nand clear the fridge.\n“Why do things go bad?” asks Tara. \n“Everything goes bad over time. \nIt’s because of microbes.  \nMicrobes are very tiny living things \nthat are around us. \nWhen it’s warm, \nfood goes bad faster \nbecause microbes multiply quickly. \nThe cold air of the fridge \nkeeps food fresh for longer \nand they multiply slowly!” \nsays Ma.\n“Does all food spoil?” asks Tara. \n“Not this rice,” says Ma, \n“Or these potatoes, \nat least for a while.” \n“And not this pickle,” says Pa. \n“And not this ghee,” says Ma. \n“We can eat ghee rice and potatoes!” \nsays Tara, happily.\n\nStory: Ashwitha Jayakumar\nIllustrator: Tarique Aziz\nAnimation: BookBox\nTranslation: Pratham Books Team\nNarration: Anu Anand\nMusic: Rajesh Gilbert\n\nThis story has been provided for free under the CC-BY license by Pratham Books, which is a not-for-profit children's books publisher with a mission to see \"A book in every child's hand\".
